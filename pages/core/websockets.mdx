# WebSockets

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing real-time data exchange between clients and servers.

## Core Concepts

- **Full-Duplex Communication:** Enables simultaneous two-way data exchange.
- **Persistent Connection:** Maintains an open connection for continuous data flow.
- **Low Latency:** Reduces the delay in data transmission.

## Use Cases

- **Real-Time Chat Applications:** Enables instant messaging between users.
- **Live Updates:** Provides real-time updates for dashboards and notifications.
- **Online Gaming:** Facilitates real-time interactions in multiplayer games.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency:** Reduces overhead by maintaining a single connection.
- **Scalability:** Supports a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Interactivity:** Enhances user experience with real-time interactions.

## Implementation Example
```

To implement WebSockets, you need to:
1. Establish a WebSocket connection between the client and server.
2. Handle incoming and outgoing messages.
3. Close the connection when it's no longer needed.

```javascript
// Example of a simple WebSocket server in Node.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log('Received:', message);
    // Broadcast the message to all clients
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(message);
      }
    });
  });

  ws.send('Welcome to the WebSocket server!');
});
