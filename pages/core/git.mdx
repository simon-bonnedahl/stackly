# Version Control with Git


Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain a detailed history of their projects. This guide covers the basics of Git, its core commands, and best practices for effective version control.

## What is Git?

- **Definition:** Git is a tool for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **Key Features:** Distributed architecture, branching, merging, and a robust history of changes.

## Basic Git Commands

- **Initialization:**  
  ~~~bash
  git init
  ~~~  
  Initializes a new Git repository.

- **Cloning:**  
  ~~~bash
  git clone [repository URL]
  ~~~  
  Clones an existing repository from a remote server.

- **Staging and Committing:**  
  ~~~bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  ~~~  
  Stages changes and commits them to the repository.

- **Viewing Status and History:**  
  ~~~bash
  git status
  git log
  ~~~

- **Remote Repositories:** Use platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **Pull Requests:** Facilitate code reviews and collaboration.
- **Rebasing:**  
  ~~~bash
  git rebase main
  ~~~  
  Helps keep a clean commit history.

## Best Practices

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Commit small, incremental changes.
- Regularly synchronize your local repository with remote changes.
