# Command Line & Terminal Basics

The command line is an essential tool for developers. It provides a powerful interface to interact with your operating system and manage tasks efficiently. This guide covers the fundamentals of using the command line, including basic commands, navigation, and best practices.

## What is the Command Line?

The command line is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. It is commonly used for tasks such as file manipulation, running scripts, and automating repetitive tasks.

## Basic Commands

Some common commands include:
- **`ls` or `dir`:** List files and directories.
- **`cd`:** Change the current directory.
- **`pwd`:** Display the current directory path.
- **`mkdir`:** Create a new directory.
- **`rm`:** Remove files or directories.
- **`cp` and `mv`:** Copy or move files.

## File System Navigation

- **Absolute Paths:** Paths that start from the root directory.
- **Relative Paths:** Paths relative to your current directory.

## Advanced Commands and Tools

- **Piping and Redirection:** Use symbols like `|`, `>`, and `<` to chain commands and redirect output.
- **Command History:** Access previous commands using the up/down arrow keys.
- **Aliases:** Create shortcuts for frequently used commands (e.g., `alias ll="ls -la"`).

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use the `man` command (e.g., `man ls`) to read manual pages for more details.
- Experiment with different shells (Bash, Zsh, PowerShell) to find the one that best fits your workflow.
- Practice writing simple shell scripts to automate routine tasks.
