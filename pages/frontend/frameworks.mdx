# Frontend Frameworks

Modern frontend development offers a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries that simplify the process of building dynamic, responsive, and scalable user interfaces. In this section, you'll find detailed guides on several popular frameworks and libraries, each with its unique approach and strengths.

## Frameworks and Libraries

- **[React](/frontend/frameworks/react):** A powerful library for building user interfaces using a component-based architecture.
- **[Angular](/frontend/frameworks/angular):** A comprehensive framework developed by Google for building large-scale, enterprise-grade applications.
- **[Vue](/frontend/frameworks/vue):** A progressive framework that offers simplicity and flexibility for creating interactive web interfaces.
- **[Svelte](/frontend/frameworks/svelte):** A modern framework that compiles your components to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript, eliminating the need for a virtual DOM.
- **[Next.js](/frontend/frameworks/nextjs):** A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO.
- **[SolidJS](/frontend/frameworks/solidjs):** A declarative library that leverages fine-grained reactivity for fast and efficient UI updates without a virtual DOM.

Each guide provides an in-depth look at the framework’s core concepts, tooling, best practices, and resources to help you get started or deepen your understanding.
