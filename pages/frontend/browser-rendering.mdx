# Browser Rendering

Modern browsers are sophisticated engines that transform HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into interactive web pages. This document provides an overview of the browser rendering process, based on the [Frontend Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).

## How Browsers Work

### Parsing HTML and Building the DOM

- **HTML Parsing:**  
  When a browser loads a web page, it begins by parsing the HTML document.
- **DOM Tree:**  
  The HTML is converted into a Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the page structure in a tree-like format.

### Parsing CSS and Building the CSSOM

- **CSS Parsing:**  
  The browser downloads and parses CSS files.
- **CSSOM Tree:**  
  The CSS rules are organized into a CSS Object Model (CSSOM), which is used to apply styles to the DOM elements.

### Constructing the Render Tree

- **Render Tree:**  
  The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM trees to form the render tree, containing only the nodes required for rendering.
- **Layout Calculation:**  
  Using the render tree, the browser computes the layout, determining the size and position of each element.

### Painting and Compositing

- **Painting:**  
  The browser paints the visual representation of elements onto the screen.
- **Compositing:**  
  For complex pages, the browser may split the render tree into layers and composite them, optimizing the rendering process.

## The Critical Rendering Path

- **Definition:**  
  The critical rendering path is the sequence of steps a browser follows to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.
- **Optimization Strategies:**  
  - Minimize render-blocking resources such as CSS and JavaScript.
  - Load non-critical scripts asynchronously.
  - Optimize images and other media to reduce load time.

## Performance Considerations

- **Reflow and Repaint:**  
  - **Reflow (Layout):** Occurs when the browser recalculates the layout of the page due to DOM changes.
  - **Repaint:** Occurs when visual changes (e.g., color changes) are applied without affecting layout.
- **Minimizing Layout Thrashing:**  
  Avoid frequent DOM manipulations that trigger reflow and repaint to maintain smooth performance.
- **Hardware Acceleration:**  
  Utilize CSS transforms and animations to leverage GPU acceleration for improved rendering performance.
