# SolidJS

SolidJS is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages fine-grained reactivity to update the DOM efficiently without using a virtual DOM. SolidJS is designed to be fast and simple, offering a developer experience similar to React but with improved performance through its reactive system.

## Core Concepts

### Fine-Grained Reactivity

- **Reactivity:** SolidJS uses a reactive system where computations automatically update when their dependencies change. Unlike some frameworks that rely on a virtual DOM, SolidJS updates only the affected parts of the DOM.
- **Signals:** The primary reactive primitive in SolidJS is a signal. Signals are functions that store values and notify dependent computations when they change.

~~~jsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count()}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
~~~

### JSX and Components

- **JSX:** SolidJS uses JSX for templating. Components are simple functions that return JSX.
- **Components:** Create reusable UI components with a functional approach.

~~~jsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
~~~

### Stores and State Management

- **Stores:** SolidJS provides simple reactive stores for managing state in more complex applications.
- **Reactivity in Stores:** When a store's property changes, components using that store automatically update.

~~~jsx
import { createStore } from "solid-js/store";

function TodoApp() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = createStore([{ text: "Learn SolidJS", done: false }]);

  function addTodo(text) {
    setTodos([...todos, { text, done: false }]);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={() => addTodo("New Task")}>Add Todo</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoApp;
~~~

## Tooling and Ecosystem

- **Solid Start:** The official framework for building SolidJS applications with routing, SSR, and more.
- **Bundlers and Tooling:** SolidJS integrates well with popular bundlers like Vite for fast development experiences.
- **Community:** A growing community with an increasing number of plugins, libraries, and learning resources.
