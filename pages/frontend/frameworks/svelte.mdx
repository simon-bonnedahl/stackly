# Svelte

Svelte is a modern frontend framework that takes a unique approach to building user interfaces. Rather than using a virtual DOM, Svelte shifts much of the work to compile time, converting your components into efficient imperative code that updates the DOM directly.

## Core Concepts

### Compiler-Driven Framework

- **Compilation:** Svelte compiles your components during build time, producing optimized JavaScript with minimal runtime overhead.
- **No Virtual DOM:** Instead of diffing and patching a virtual DOM, Svelte updates the actual DOM directly, resulting in improved performance.

### Reactive Declarations

- **Reactivity:** In Svelte, reactivity is achieved with simple assignments. When a variable's value changes, the UI updates automatically.
- **Reactive Statements:** Use the `$:` syntax to create reactive statements that re-run whenever their dependencies change.

~~~svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;

  // Reactive declaration: updates whenever `count` changes
  $: doubled = count * 2;
</script>

<p>Count: {count}</p>
<p>Doubled: {doubled}</p>
<button on:click={() => count += 1}>Increment</button>
~~~

### Single-File Components

- **Component Structure:** Svelte components are written in single `.svelte` files that encapsulate HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
- **Scoped Styles:** CSS defined within a Svelte component is scoped by default, reducing the risk of style conflicts across components.

~~~svelte
<style>
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<script>
  export let name = "World";
</script>

<p>Hello, {name}!</p>
~~~

## Tooling and Ecosystem

- **SvelteKit:** The official framework for building Svelte applications, offering features such as file-based routing, server-side rendering, and more.
- **Developer Experience:** Svelte's simple syntax and powerful reactivity model make it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
- **Community:** A growing ecosystem with an increasing number of plugins, integrations, and resources.
