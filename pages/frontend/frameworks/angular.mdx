# Angular

Angular is a comprehensive framework maintained by Google for building dynamic web applications. It offers a complete solution with features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a modular architecture.

## Core Concepts

- **Components and Templates:** Angular uses components to encapsulate logic and templates to define the UI.
- **Modules:** Applications are structured using NgModules, which help organize code and manage dependencies.
- **Data Binding:** Supports both one-way and two-way data binding to synchronize the view and the model.
- **Dependency Injection:** Angularâ€™s built-in DI system provides services and dependencies to components efficiently.
- **Directives:** Extend HTML with custom attributes and elements to add dynamic behavior.

## Tooling and CLI

Angular CLI simplifies many development tasks:
- **Project Scaffolding:** Easily generate components, services, and modules.
- **Development Server:** Provides live reloading during development.
- **Build Optimizations:** Supports ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, tree shaking, and bundling for optimized performance.

## State Management

- **Services and Observables:** Use Angular services and RxJS to manage asynchronous data streams.
- **NgRx:** A Redux-inspired state management library for Angular, suitable for complex applications.

## Testing

Angular provides robust testing support:
- **Unit Testing:** Use Jasmine and Karma for component and service tests.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Tools like Protractor or Cypress help ensure application reliability.
