# React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture to create reusable UI components and manage application state effectively. This document, based on the [Frontend Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend), covers the essential topics of React.

## Core Concepts

### Components

- **Definition:** Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either functional or class-based.
- **JSX:** JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
- **Props:** Properties passed from parent components to child components.
- **State:** Internal data that a component manages and can change over time.

### Functional Components and Hooks

- **Functional Components:** Simple components defined as functions.
- **Hooks:** Functions such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` that enable state and side effects in functional components.

Example of a functional component using hooks:

~~~jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
~~~

### Class Components

- **Class Components:** Traditional components created using ES6 classes.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Methods such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` manage the component lifecycle.

Example of a class component:

~~~jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Greeting extends Component {
  state = { name: 'World' };

  componentDidMount() {
    // Perform any side effects here
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.state.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
~~~

## State Management

- **Local State:** Managed within a component using hooks (or `this.state` in class components).
- **Global State:** Managed with libraries like Redux, MobX, or using React's Context API.

## Routing

- **React Router:** A popular library for handling client-side routing in React applications.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Enables navigation between different views or pages within a React app.

## Testing in React

- **Testing Libraries:** Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests of React components.
- **Snapshot Testing:** Ensure UI consistency through snapshot tests.
