# Testing & Debugging

Testing and debugging are critical to ensuring your frontend applications are reliable and maintainable. This guide covers key techniques and tools for both.

## Unit Testing

- **Definition:** Testing individual components or functions to verify they work as expected.
- **Tools:**
  - **Jest:** A popular JavaScript testing framework.
  - **Mocha:** A flexible testing framework for Node.js.
- **Example using Jest:**

~~~javascript
// sum.js
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// sum.test.js
import { sum } from './sum';

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
~~~

## Integration & End-to-End Testing

- **Integration Testing:** Verifies that multiple parts of your application work together.
  - **React Testing Library:** Helps test React components in a way that mimics user interactions.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulates real user scenarios.
  - **Cypress:** A powerful tool for writing end-to-end tests.

## Debugging Techniques

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools, etc., to inspect elements, debug JavaScript, and analyze performance.
- **Console Logging:** Utilize `console.log`, `console.error`, etc., to trace code execution.
- **Source Maps:** Enable source maps to debug transpiled or minified code.
- **Error Boundaries (in React):** Catch JavaScript errors in components and display fallback UIs.

## Best Practices

- Write tests concurrently with your code.
- Automate tests in your CI/CD pipeline.
- Regularly update tests to reflect code changes.
