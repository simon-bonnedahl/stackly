# Accessibility

Accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) ensures that your web applications are usable by all people, including those with disabilities. This guide outlines best practices and tools to enhance accessibility.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity:** Make your content available to a broader audience.
- **Compliance:** Meet legal standards and guidelines.
- **Improved Usability:** Accessible designs often provide a better overall user experience.

## Best Practices

### Semantic HTML

- Use proper HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to provide meaningful structure.
- Prefer native elements like `<button>` and `<a>` for interactive actions.

### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

- Use ARIA roles, states, and properties when native HTML is insufficient.
- Example: `role="alert"`, `aria-live="polite"`, and `aria-label`.

### Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are operable via keyboard.
- Provide clear focus indicators (using CSS) for elements when they are in focus.

### Color Contrast

- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background.
- Test your choices with tools like the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

## Tools for Testing Accessibility

- **Browser Extensions:** Tools such as Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse can audit your pages for accessibility issues.
- **Screen Readers:** Use NVDA, VoiceOver, or JAWS to simulate the experience of users with visual impairments.
