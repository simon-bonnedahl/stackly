# Backend Runtime Environments

Backend runtime environments provide the foundation for executing server-side code. Each runtime has its own characteristics, features, and use cases.

## Popular Runtime Environments

### Node.js
- **Type:** JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine
- **Release Date:** 2009
- **Key Features:**
  - Non-blocking I/O
  - Large package ecosystem (npm)
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Active community
- **Best for:** Web servers, APIs, real-time applications

### Deno
- **Type:** Modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript
- **Release Date:** 2020
- **Key Features:**
  - Built-in TypeScript support
  - Secure by default
  - Standard library
  - URL-based imports
- **Best for:** Modern TypeScript applications, secure environments

### Bun
- **Type:** All-in-one JavaScript runtime
- **Release Date:** 2022
- **Key Features:**
  - Extremely fast startup
  - Built-in bundler and test runner
  - npm compatibility
  - WebSocket support
- **Best for:** High-performance applications, development tooling

## Runtime Comparison

| Feature | Node.js | Deno | Bun |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| Engine | V8 | V8 | JavaScriptCore |

| TypeScript Support | Via transpilation | Built-in | Built-in |
| Security | Permissive | Secure by default | Permissive |
| File System Access | Unrestricted | Permission-based | Unrestricted |
| Build Tools | External | Built-in | Built-in |
| Test Runner | External | Built-in | Built-in |
| HTTP Server | External | Built-in | Built-in |
| WebSocket Support | External | Built-in | Built-in |

## Performance Benchmarks

### HTTP Server Performance
- **Bun:** ~180,000 req/sec
- **Node.js:** ~60,000 req/sec
- **Deno:** ~70,000 req/sec

### Startup Time
- **Bun:** < 10ms
- **Node.js:** ~100ms
- **Deno:** ~50ms

*Note: Benchmarks are approximate and may vary based on hardware and specific use cases.*

## Market Adoption

## Choosing a Runtime

Consider these factors when selecting a runtime environment:

1. **Performance Requirements:** Evaluate the runtime's execution speed and resource usage
2. **Security Needs:** Consider the security features and defaults
3. **Ecosystem:** Assess the availability of packages and tools
4. **Team Experience:** Consider your team's familiarity with the runtime
5. **Production Requirements:** Evaluate deployment and scaling capabilities
