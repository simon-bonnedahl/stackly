# Backend Frameworks Overview

Modern backend development offers various frameworks for building server-side applications. Here's a concise overview of popular backend frameworks:

## Framework List

### Express.js üöÄ
(Released 2010) - A minimalist Node.js framework focused on building fast, unopinionated web applications and APIs with a robust middleware ecosystem.

### Django üêç
(Released 2005) - A high-level Python framework that follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, perfect for building complex web applications with built-in admin interface and security features.

### Spring üåº
(Released 2002) - A comprehensive Java framework designed for enterprise applications, offering powerful dependency injection and extensive middleware support.

### Laravel üåê
(Released 2011) - An elegant PHP framework with expressive syntax, making it ideal for modern web application development with built-in authentication and ORM.

- **NestJS** (Released 2017) - A progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript, incorporating elements of OOP, FP, and FRP for scalable server-side applications.

- **Hono** (Released 2022) - A lightweight, ultrafast web framework for edge computing platforms, offering TypeScript support and minimal overhead.
